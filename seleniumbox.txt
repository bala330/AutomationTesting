1.Explain difference between Selenium IDE, Selenium WebDriver and Selenium Grid
Selenium is a popular open-source suite of tools for automating web browsers, and it consists of several components, including Selenium IDE, Selenium WebDriver, and Selenium Grid. Each of these components serves a specific role in the web automation process. Here are the key differences between Selenium IDE, Selenium WebDriver, and Selenium Grid.
SeleniumIDE:
*Selenium IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is primarily designed for record-and-playback of browser interactions. Itâ€™s a browser extension that allows testers to record their interactions with a web application and then replay those interactions as automated tests.
*Selenium IDE provides a simple and user-friendly graphical interface, making it accessible to non-programmers and testers with minimal coding experience.
*Selenium IDE uses its own scripting language that is less flexible and powerful than the programming languages used with WebDriver.
*Selenium IDE typically supports fewer browsers compared to WebDriver. It is often browser-specific and limited in cross-browser testing capabilities.
*While Selenium IDE is suitable for simple test cases and quick test script generation, it may not be ideal for complex test scenarios or advanced automation requirements.

Selenium Webdriver:
*Selenium WebDriver is a programmatic interface for automating web browsers. It allows developers and testers to write code in their preferred programming language (e.g., Java, Python, C#) to create and execute browser automation scripts.
*WebDriver offers greater flexibility and control over web automation tasks compared to Selenium IDE. It can handle complex scenarios and interact with web elements at a fine-grained level.
*WebDriver is well-suited for cross-browser testing as it supports multiple browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and others.
*WebDriver can be integrated into various test frameworks and CI/CD pipelines, making it suitable for both automated testing and continuous integration scenarios.
*WebDriver is designed for single-browser automation. If you need to run tests across multiple browsers and on different machines simultaneously, Selenium Grid is used in conjunction with WebDriver.

Selenium Grid:
*Selenium Grid is used for distributing test execution across multiple machines and browsers in a network. It facilitates parallel execution of tests, making it suitable for large-scale automation and cross-browser testing.
*Selenium Grid allows you to scale your automation infrastructure by connecting multiple WebDriver instances running on different machines (nodes) to a central hub.
*Selenium Grid enables parallel testing, which significantly reduces test execution time, especially when you need to run tests across various browser and OS combinations simultaneously.
*You can configure Selenium Grid to distribute tests based on desired capabilities, such as specific browser versions, operating systems, and device types.
*Selenium Grid provides a centralized management system for executing tests across a distributed network of machines, making it easier to orchestrate and monitor test runs.

3.What is Selenium?How it is useful in Automation Testing?
*Selenium is an open-source suite of tools and libraries that is used for browser automation.
*Selenium used to: It allows users to test their websites functionally on different browsers.
*Perform cross browser testing to check if the website functions consistently across different browsers.
*Selenium can only test web applications,Unfortunately, so desktop and mobile apps can't be tested.

4.What are all browser driver is used in selenium?
*Chrome browser
Example: webdriver driver = new chromedriver();
*Firefox browser
Example: webdriver driver=new Firefoxdriver();
*IEDriver browser
Example: webdriver driver=new InternetExploredriver();
*Safari browser
Example:webdriver driver=new SafariDriver();
*Opera browser
Example:Webdriver driver=new operadriver();
